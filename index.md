## Overview
This site tracks the goals, datasets, experiments, and results for applying transfer learning to clinical decision-making in Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS), including SNOT-22–based outcomes.

- **Primary objective:** Develop models that generalize across cohorts collected with slightly different structures but similar clinical targets.
- **Near-term focus:** Data familiarization exercise on SNOT-22 item-level scores.

## Milestones (working list)
- [ ] Data familiarization exercise on 2R01/3R01 SNOT-22 item scores (Q1–Q22).
- [ ] EDA + missingness patterns; score distributions; correlation heatmaps.
- [ ] Baseline models; cross-cohort validation plan.
- [ ] Transfer learning approach draft; experiments.
