# Updates & Meeting Notes

## 2025-08-14 — Kickoff Sync (Dr. Chowdhury)
- **Plan:** Near-future = build reusable pipeline ready for German dataset; Long-term = common embeddings + transfer learning.
- **Methods to explore:** Binary classification with neural nets; **Siamese networks**; **common embedding** strategies.
- **Practice dataset:** INSPIRE (PhysioNet) — identify prediction targets and create a baseline model in PyTorch.
- **Cadence:** Weekly meeting (time TBA).

## 2025-08-11 (Kickoff Meeting Scheduled)
- Meeting planned with Dr. Chowdhury to discuss dataset familiarization and initial exercise.
- Created GitHub Pages site for project showcase.
